# Fullstack-Emaily

This project is based on Stephen Grider's [Fullstack Web Development][1] course. It uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to create a service that delivers surveys via email.

You can view the project at it's current point by following [this][2] link... if I have the server running.

I've been taking notes with pen and paper, like an old person, but I've been advised that I should add more information to the README to show that I'm not just copying and pasting code, as I follow along. So, I will try to add something soon for anyone who might be following along--possibly in the form of a blog. Until then, if you have questions or comments, reach out! I'm always interested in what could be done better and how. Thanks! :)
